# Introduction to Kubernetes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/kube101.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/kube101)

This repository contains introductory material for Kubernetes.

There is a presenter-run [meetup](https://github.com/svennam92/kube101/tree/d87628eae629edf45250e56e7792d692e4d83638/presentation/meetup.pptx), including [automated scripts](presentation/scripts.md) for running a demonstration of Kubernetes as provided by IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. This should take from 45 minutes to an hour and a half based on the style of the presenter as well as audience participation.

There is a self-guided or host-guided [workshop](workshop/), with detailed explanations about the principles of operating an application in a Kubernetes environment. Including some time for setup, this should take between 2-4 hours.
