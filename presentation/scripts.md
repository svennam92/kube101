# Instructions for Running the Presentation Demo Scripts

## The following are needed:

* `bx` executable
* `bx cs` plugin
* `docker` installed
* `kubectl`

## Prereq steps:

* Pick a name for your cluster \(e.g. `osscluster`\)
* Pick a name for your Registry namespace \(e.g. `kube101`\)
* Log into IBM Cloud: `bx login` or if you use sso: `bx login --sso`
* Log into the IBM Registry: `bx cr login`
* Create a Kubernetes cluster: `bx cs cluster-create --name osscluster`, if

  it doesn't already exist

* Create the registry namespace: `bx cr namespace-add kube101`, if it doesn't

  already exist

## Running the demo scripts

* Modify the `common.sh` file to make sure your cluster and registry

  namespace values are set properly

* Run each `sh` file as instructed in the [presentation](https://github.com/svennam92/kube101/tree/d87628eae629edf45250e56e7792d692e4d83638/presentation/Workshop.pptx)
* As the scripts are running press `ENTER` or `space` when it pauses
* If you press `f` it will remove the delay as it types
* If you press `r` it will remove the pauses. So, if you want to do both

  press `f` before you press `r`

## Cleaning up

Run `clean.sh` to clean up the environment. It does not erase your cluster or registry namespace.

## Automated running of scripts

To run all of the script in an automated way, make sure your cluster and registry namespace are ready and then:

```text
SKIP=1 DELAY=0 ./all.sh
```

`SKIP=1` tells it to not pause at each command

`DELAY=0` tells it to not print slowly, simulating typing
