# Contributing In General

Our project welcomes external contributions! If you have an itch, please feel free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a pull request to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IBM/kube101).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/IBM/kube101/issues). Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, please quickly get in touch with us via an issue.

**We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution requires extensive rework \(by you or by us\), sits in the queue for a long time, or cannot be accepted at all!**

## Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/IBM/kube101/issues) before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid you spending your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers are not willing to accept into the code base.

## Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/IBM/kube101/issues) before sending a pull request so it can be discussed. If the fix is trivial or non controversial then this is not usually necessary.

## Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM \(Looks Good To Me\) in comments on the code review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the maintainers of each component affected. Note that if your initial push does not pass TravisCI your change will not be approved.

For more details, see the [MAINTAINERS](maintainers.md) page.
